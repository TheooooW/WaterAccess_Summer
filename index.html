								<h3>Motivation</h3>
								<p id="justified">Clean water is one of the most important need of a human to survive in their daily lives. Water is a basic human right and everyone should have access to clean water, but not all people have it.</p>

								<h3>Problem</h3>
								<p id="justified"> Without water, a human may only survive for up to 3 days (WHO, 2021), while having no access to clean water, people result to drinking unclean/unfiltered water and one of the disease they can get is deadly disease Cholera. Vibrio cholerae is the bacteria that causes it which lives in unsanitized/unclean waters and warm environment which is common in the Philippines (CDC, 2023).</p>

						<h2 align="center"> Discussion </h2>
						<p id="justified">The researchers visualized the correlation between the percentage of clean water access and the number of Cholera cases per region in 2020 with the collected data from the Philippine Statistics Authority for the number of cholera cases per region and water access of households per municipality in 2022 from HumData by OHCA. </p>
						<p id="justified">By separating the data on household access to Clean and Unclean water access, the researchers represented the percentage of clean against unclean water access using a bar graph. The graph shows that <b>Region 4-B and Region-9 have the lowest clean water percentage at 67% and NCR exhibits the highest at 93% clean water access.</b> </p>
						<p id="justified">The results indicate <b>differences in water access between rural and urban regions, with urban areas having higher percentages of clean water access.</b> The researchers also used a scatter plot to examine the relationship between cholera cases and the percentage of clean water access per Region. The plot shows a <b> positive correlation between the number of cholera cases and clean water access.</b>Furthermore, Region IV-A shows over 200 cases of Cholera, followed by Region VI, <b>suggesting that there is an upward trend relationship between cholera and the percentage of clean water access per region.</b></p> 
						<p id="justified">Upon further inspection</b>, Region IV-A has the highest number of households with access to water<b> followed by NCR. However, there is a <b>significant difference in the number of cholera cases between the two regions</b>. Therefore, the inferred relationship between the number of cholera cases and water access per region might be<b> spurious.</b></p>

						<h2>Conclusion and Recomendation</h2>
						<h1>Clean Water does not mean Cholera-Safe </h1>	
						<p id="justified">The clean water access needs to be improved in the Philippines.</b> In some regions, only 67% of households have access to clean water, which is very low, especially for a basic necessity. This research found a <b>positive correlation</b> between water access and the number of cholera cases. This indicates that there is another underlying issue that cannot be solved solely by providing clean water to every household. This pushes future <b>studies to focus on more marine life and the biology of Vibrio Cholerae in the Philippines </b>to reduce the incidence of cholera in the Philippines.</p>
						<p id="justified">Additionally, there is a <b>clear disparity </b>between the clean water access of regions. This calls for the <b>government to allocate more budget and projects to improve clean water access, proper water disposal, and water irrigation to rural areas, especially in Region 4 and 9, </b>which has the lowest percentage of clean water access and cholera cases are prevalent. </p>
						<p id="justified">With the current data, the researchers realized a limitation: <b>the current model cannot account for the relationship between the number of cholera cases per region and clean water access per region. </b>Future research could explore <b>additional variables </b>such as demographics, education, assets, and housing conditions. Incorporating these factors might provide more insights into what causes cholera cases in the Philippines.</b></p> 
						<p id="justified"><b>A recommended project for the government is that water areas that is accessible by the people (ponds, lakes, rivers, etc.), should have </b>atleast a monthly check up for cleanliness and a microbiology test.<b> This check-up should conclude either to allow people to use the water, or block people from accessing the water source in case of unsafe water conditions or infective bacteria.</p>
						<p id="justified">Lastly, the study advises <b>Filipinos to be wary in the water that comes into contact especially in places where there are outbreaks of Cholera</b>, advising to always check on the news, be mindful of the water you use especially when it comes from unhealthy sources, and to <b>always report on cases of illness and sickness immediately</b> as these may cause an outbreak and infect more people which we do not want.</p>
